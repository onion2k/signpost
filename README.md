# signpost

A generator for making 3D models of those signposts that point to lots of faraway places.

* Done: Boilerplate page to load in three, etc
* Done: 3D geometry generator to make a basic signpost with dynamically added arms
* Done: Placename materials in canvas
* Done: Geocoder to enable discovering distances to and from a place
* Done: Decide on a UI framework
* TODO: A nice UI
* TODO: Nicer materials shader(?) for signpost and arms
* TODO: Animation on elements
* TODO: Controls for rotation
* Done: A socket.io based API to geocode in 'realtime'
* TODO: Save to localstorage (or API?)
* TODO: STL Export
* TODO: Print service integration
* TODO: Investigate OSM geocoding
